EditableContent
===============

This Rails plugin allows for in place editing of HTML content that is then stored in the database. It places an 'edit' link next to a block of HTML content that when clicked opens a text area to edit the text, preview it, and save it to the database. It can be used for simple content management.

Requirements
============

The plugin uses Rails 2.3 engines functionality. If you wish to use it in versions lower than 2.3 you will need to copy the files from the app/ direction in the plugin to your application.

The plugin uses JQuery for the javascript that it generates.

The plugin uses the following line of code to allow access to the edit functionality. It expects these methods and objects to be available:
logged_in? and current_user.admin?

Installing
==========

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/pjhyett/auto_migrations.git

After installing generate the migration for the editable_contents table:
ruby script/generate editable_content_migration
rake db:migrate

Example
=======

In your view:
<% editable_content('unique_name_of_section') do %>
 This is some content the user should be able to edit.
<% end %>

The code looks for a row in the editable_contents table with the name 'unique_name_of_section' and if found replaces the text in the block with that content of that row. Otherwise it creates a new row with the text in the block.
